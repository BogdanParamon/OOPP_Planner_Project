# Code of conduct

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You correctly put a single file in the right place with the right naming in the repository.


### General

Mark: Good

Feedback: Overall, I think you have done a good job in most of the sections, the improvements would be individually in the sub-sections.


### Assignment Description

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The assignment you wrote sounds good, but it would be nice to have all the deliverables for the project listed in this section and also have it more details.

### Products

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The products sound good, but you have forgot to mention where the code will be shared and also what standards thw submitted work will meet.

### Planning

Mark: Good

Feedback: The planning sounds really good and the idea is right, I would suggest also looking a look into what GitLab has to offer for this point and making use of it.

### Communication

Mark: Good

Feedback: The communication channels sound good, you cover everything but there is no mention of what is communicated on which channel.


### Commitment

Mark: Good

Feedback: The metrics sound good, maybe giving more specific metrics and ways to measure the work would improve the assessment part.


### Division of Tasks and Roles

Mark: Good

Feedback: The way to divide tasks and roles sound reasonable, you can look into creating GitLab issues for creating agendas and adding the notes for example to make it clearer to everyone.

### Meetings

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The meetings seem to have a good schedule, but you did not mention how you will conduct non-TA meetings (will you have a chair or an agenda for those meetings?).

### Decision Making

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: You have given a way to make a decision that would work, but you did not consider the case where someone does not really agree and you have not thought of including my feedback or suggestions in the decision :)).

### Dealing with Conflicts
  
Mark: Good

Feedback: Good answer, but it does not cover all cases (for example someone might not agree even after all the discussions) and you did not mention how you will react in those situations or how can I help you solve the conflicts except by sharing my opinion.

### Guidance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: We have discussed this together and sounds good to me.

### Consequences
  
Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: You wrote some general consequences but you did not differentiate between the gravity of them so that will make for example being 5 minutes late equally bad as missing an entire meeting, which is not optimal. 

### Success Factors
  
Mark: Very Good

Feedback: This sounds really good and seems to relate a lot to your team.

### Norms or Evaluation Criteria

Mark: Good

Feedback: The criteria sound good, but you have not argued about why you consider them important for your team.
