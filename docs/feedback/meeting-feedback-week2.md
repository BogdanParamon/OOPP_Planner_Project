# Week 2

## Formative Assessment

- **Chair**:  Radu Serban
- **Notetaker**: Neel Lodha

### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: You sent the agenda sometime before the meeting, which was really nice. It was nice that you followed the template. You can add the chairman and minute-taker to the agenda to make it more clear.

### Chair performance

Mark: Very good

Feedback: I liked you went over all the points and try to include everyone in the discussion. I think you can further improve on the time estimates, which is an idea to add to the agenda instead of the exact minutes where you should talk about a subject.

#### Relation

Mark: Sufficient

Many of you were not really contributing. It's okay if you have less to say or are shy, but make sure you are involved and talk more without waiting for the chair to ask for your opinion.
