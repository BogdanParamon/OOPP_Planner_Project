### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You do not need to have the names including -draft or -final because I can tell by the upload date, but this is just a nit and you can fix it next time.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: I liked the structure and how you covered everything in the backlog, it was really comprehensive. There were some grammar mistakes that can be removed for the final version.


### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: I would try to find specific epics to the project, not only the Moscow method for prioritization (check the assignment description).  Also, I would try to make sure the mocks are used throughout the document to improve the points being made.


### User Stories

Mark: Good

Feedback: The user stories format was followed throughout the document and they had the user focus, with good granularity. I would further improve the reasoning for some of the stories (especially from the admin perspective).

### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Good

Feedback: The user stories had good granularity and I feel that some of them can be formulated in a more measurable way in order to decide when they are finished (be more specific)
