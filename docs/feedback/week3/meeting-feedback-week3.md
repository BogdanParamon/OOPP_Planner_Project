# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Filip Čajági
Minute taker: Bogdan Paramon

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Try to write who is the chairman and the minute taker in the agenda so it becomes clearer.

#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository in time and it followed the template, which was really nice. You did not have all the points the teammates wanted to talk about, so maybe talk before to make sure the agenda is complete.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: The minutes seem comprehensive and clear, I would add maybe what decisions were made during the meeting and the task distribution to make sure everything is remembered by everyone.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The chair led the meeting and ensured everything was covered, I liked that he contributed more than in the previous meetings. All topics were covered and still have a lot of time left.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Many of you were not really contributing. It's okay if you have less to say or are shy, but make sure you are involved and talk more without waiting for the chair to ask for your opinion (it holds from last week). Overall, the atmosphere was nice and everyone listened to each other and the meeting seemed constructive.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: You have made the template project work, but you should start delivering code every week and showcase your project.
