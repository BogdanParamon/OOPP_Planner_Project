# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Suruo Zhang
Minute taker: Vasil Chirov

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository in time and it followed the template, which was nice. You did not have all the points the teammates wanted to talk about, so maybe talk before to make sure the agenda is complete.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: The minutes seem comprehensive and clear. I see you follow the template and I like you planned the logged when the next meeting will be.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The chair led the meeting and ensured everything was covered. All topics were covered and still have a lot of time left, so I would try to not fill up with random discussions: even prepare more points and everything or finish the meeting short. Towards the end the meeting seems to just discuss random points to fill up the time.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Many of you were not really contributing. It's okay if you have less to say or are shy, but make sure you are involved and talk more without waiting for the chair to ask for your opinion (it holds from last week again x2). Overall, the atmosphere was nice and everyone listened to each other and the meeting seemed constructive.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: You have not started coding yet, but we strongly advise you to start as soon as possible and deliver code that works on the main and present a demo every week from this point on.
